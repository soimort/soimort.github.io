# %{BETA}

#### What tool do you use to create your website?

GNU Emacs.

#### What tool do you use to …?

GNU Emacs.

#### Is Emacs superior than Vim?

Yes.

#### Is Vim superior than Emacs?

Yes.

#### Is command-line interface superior than graphical interface?

Not really. It's just faster and more flexible than many poorly designed GUIs.

#### What's your operating system of choice?

A non-rolling [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) installation of GNU/Linux. Because Arch is *simpler* than others. "Simple" in the sense that users always have easy and straightforward control of things, not in a sense like "having this fancy suspicious shit installed is just one-click-away".

Because I can't risk breaking my system unintentionally for updates I don't badly need, I no longer follow the official Arch development and I'm against its rolling release model.

#### Which DE / WM do you use?

GNOME 3. Every desktop environment sucks, this one just sucks less.

I don't usually have that many (like, 3 or more) windows tiling on my screen to distract myself. And I hardly call that efficiency. Whenever there's a full-fledged DE, I use it for a consistent user experience.

#### Do you program? How?

I don't just "program", I design best possible API and user interface with consistency and simplicity, and implement them properly with least effort.

*A program without good design is a program not worth programming.*

#### Why do you blog?

Cogito, ergo sum.

#### Will you do reciprocal links on this site?

No.

#### Will you do paid links / ads on this site?

No.

#### How can I get in touch with you?

You are most welcome to [send me an email](mailto:soi@mort.ninja). Note that I read and reply emails using a lazy evaluation strategy (namely "reply-by-need"), and I cannot guarantee a reply for every email I get, especially during the time when I drive myself crazy for tons of todos and deadlines.

Optionally, you might want to [encrypt your message](https://keybase.io/encrypt#soimort) before reaching me through an unreliable channel.

I am not a fan of instant messaging. In case you are—sorry for the inconvenience.

#### How can I find you on the Internet?

My IRC handle is `soimort`, which is also my identity on [GitHub](https://github.com/soimort) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/soimort), as well as on a few other SNS sites like [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/soimort/), [Tumblr](http://soimort.tumblr.com/) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/soimort).

I take SNS as a very personal thing. I hate impression management, ego sum qui sum. If you don't want to know me in person or not interested in stuff and nonsense that interest me, please don't bother connecting with me. There are numerous comforting people to follow on the Internet, and I'm not one of them. Spammers, unfollow-on-followback self-promoters, marketing bots and trolls that are too serious to be interesting will get blocked timely.

You won't find me on Facebook ([here](https://stallman.org/facebook.html)'s why), WeChat, Sina Weibo or any other SNS that I believe to be contributing to government surveillance and censorship.

#### How do you pronounce "soimort"?

IPA: /swa.mɔʁ/

#### Just out of curiosity, what is your real name?

Mort Yao is my mundane name. I prefer to be called simply by my first name, *Mort*, without surname or title, no matter which language you are speaking or what cultural background you have.

In East Asian cultural sphere, where it is possible to write my name in Chinese characters, there are various forms of inscribing it. In ancient [small seal script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Seal_Script) of Chinese: (it's largely logographic; see the explanation below)

![From top to bottom: 1. A woman practicing pyromancy using oracle bone (which is my family name); 2. Sun is rising above the hill; it is daybreak time (which means a thorough understanding or grasp of something); 3. Ink produced from black soil (which stands for writing or knowledge)](https://i0.wp.com/dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/vyyyqfr4o528mlv/seal-script.png)

In modern Chinese (traditional) hanzi:

:=
[Yáo](-姚)　[Xiǎomò](-曉墨)

The family name, 姚 ([Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao_\(surname\))), is one of the major surnames of Chinese antiquity, originated from [Emperor Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun) and dated back to 22nd century BC. The given name stands for 通曉文墨 (lettered and erudite).

In Japanese kanji, I write my name as: (inspired by the spirit of Zen)

:=
[やお](-八百)　[しゅうもう](-執妄)

The name originated from a Japanese [four-character idiom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-character_idiom) 頑執妄排 (obsessed with one single subject or idea, monomania); 八百 (eight hundred) implies "a great many" in Japanese. In Buddhist terms, 執 (Shū) represents upādāna and 妄 (Mō) constitutes avidyā. Thus it stands for "clinging to ignorance" or "obsessed with delusion", which is considered as one cause of pain and suffering.

I'm not a Buddhist practitioner; That's why I have chosen this name and am content with the mundane life I suffer as it is.

#### How can I meet you in person?

You'll have to run down the hill and jump over the first of the six little brooks.
