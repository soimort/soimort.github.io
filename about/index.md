## Bio

I am Mort Yao, also known as "soimort" in cyberspace, a wannabe computer [hacker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) and visual artist, currently studying computer science at [DIKU](http://www.diku.dk/) (University of Copenhagen).

Born and raised in [Nanking, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing), I spent most of my childhood on math, classical Chinese poetry and calligraphy, and as for a playful spirit, board game making and playing. At the age of 13, I started programming a first-person shooter game in Visual Basic 6.0 with Direct3D (since BASIC was the very first programming language I learned), however it was proven to be impossible because schooling had then squeezed my everyday life. As examinations dominated the entire education system in China and I could not exempt myself from them, I had to prepare myself to be a "well-trained talent on exams" instead of just "toying around with computers" all day. I was not even allowed to bring a laptop with me as a freshman newly admitted to a nationally renowned research college. Having studied geophysics in the college, I found myself more passionate about skateboarding and photography than mechanical and electromagnetic analysis I was supposed to specialize in, therefore had to rethink my career path I would undertake. After some short-lived enthusiasm in systems biology and bioinformatics, I picked up C++ and served as a programmer in a software team to win an international prize. Shortly after failing a hell of a lot of my courses, I decided that I would not want to remain as an amateur programmer anymore, thus I relocated to Scandinavia and pursued a degree in software engineering in a Swedish college ("högskola") during the past 3 years.

I have been a full-time GNU/Linux user since 2011, though my experience on GCC and LaTeX is a bit earlier than that. I volunteered at [FOSDEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM), because I am quite a novice in open source and it's always good to do something that helps the community. I wrote Java and C# while learning Android and web development from courseworks in the college; however Python made it entertaining for me to follow a bunch of MOOC online courses on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), [edX](https://www.edx.org/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/), and that's the day I found education rewarding and appealing at the same time again. As soon as Standard ML introduced me to functional programming, I developed an academic interest in programming languages and type systems. Aiming at applying expressive type systems on system programming and web development for real-world use, I hack on immature creative ideas, mainly on designs of new domain-specific languages; I don't have a thing to brag about so far though.

### Public key

The fingerprint is [8A9C A653 83B6 71BC 995C CEAE 07DA 00CB 7820 3251](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x07DA00CB78203251). You may also find me on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/soimort).

### Personal & political notes

I like people who are kind and respectful; and that's also the only criterion of "how successful" I expect myself to be.

I'm a man of little secret. However, there are certain details of my life I would not easily share with someone I don't get along with, such like my birthday, family background, orientation and romance, and so on. Not only for they are private issues unimportant to strangers, but also because they won't signify *who I am*.

For the most part I am a silent guy. People tend to think I'm somewhat dull or even apathetic, though I'm actually not. I'm also a good listener. I often find it absorbing to listen to one's life stories, like I could experience a second life.

I do not judge people. The only kind of people I don't like, is those who interfered with others' well-being and showed no courtesy. I therefore tolerate and respect rights for LGBT, sex works, recreational drugs and euthanasia, but strongly against personal possession of firearms. Guns are used for killing people, not comforting them; what a sad planet to live on, if everyone can possess the intent to kill each other.

I do not support any specific political party or politician, since my judgments are made merely on whether a government policy is good or bad. I am also a pacifist; I have never been involved in any military service and never will, for my conscience told me not to.

### Religion

I am a deist. I do not subscribe to any certain religion, and I will not accept anyone's interpretation of a religious God, for I believe that one could only find the objective truth via scientific methods and look for their subjective faith from inwardness, but not from an external authority.

Stories from the Bible and the Quran often fascinate me; and I always want to read more about Zen Buddhism. That's why I sometimes quote religious sayings, though I'm not pious. Furthermore, some Christian philosophers like Søren Kierkegaard and Lev Shestov have a more-or-less intellectual influence on me.

### Languages

My mother tongue is the [Nanjing dialect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanjing_dialect) of Chinese—it used to be the official Mandarin of China, but nowadays it is likely to be spoken only at home and in localities. Standard Mandarin (or "Beijing Mandarin") is the dominant tongue at schools and workplaces. Since I haven't been studying or working in China for a while, my standard Mandarin has become more or less rusty. I was even once told by a Uyghur friend that his spoken Mandarin is "as average as mine". I don't mind it at all, since Mandarin is not my cradle tongue, anyway.

I have barely passed my last English course in a college in China, so I guess my English proficiency is just "moderate" (just saying, I then dropped out of that college; in Sweden I got a grade of 5 in every English course I took). A Chinese English teacher would normally fail me for my grammar is "not correct enough" or not thinking in the way that a question-setter would think; however, as I found out that expressing oneself clearly is a more natural thing to do than just being a Grammar Nazi, I feel more confident speaking English now. Still, I'd rather not to label myself as "proficient in English" before I can fluently finish reading the complete works of Shakespeare. (although I've hardly started)

For no practical reasons, I tried to learn a few other European languages: Spanish (because I was addicted to [magical realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_realism) since I was in high school); German (because I wanted to follow [Lacrimosa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrimosa_\(band\))'s lyrics); French (for some of the [best movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_New_Wave) ever made). However, my knowledge on none of these languages has reached a working level. So, in general: I cannot communicate in these languages yet, if it would be untrue to claim that I don't know them at all. Speaking of Danish or Swedish, I have yet to force myself to learn them—otherwise I tend to switch to English very quickly.

I have never been taught any Japanese; strange to say, but I do use it now, even better than most languages I learned on purpose. I've always wanted to "learn" Japanese in some way, like following a textbook or a language course. I never did. I might be content with my Japanese skills for now, for the simple reason that I don't live in Japan, and have no real world use of that language.

### Books

I don't have a favorite book. It might surprise you, that I am no fan of most hardcore science fictions. I like some Dystopian novels (e.g. *1984*, *Brave New World*, *Fahrenheit 451‎*), though.

Most books I own are poetry anthologies; while I believe the best books to read are those which can only be found in a library, and definitely, not cheap contemporary works on the Internet.

The writer who influenced me most is Jorge Luis Borges. For me, the man was the whole Latin America, or the magiclike Spanish-speaking world, though Spanish is a language I never fully learned. Among all American writers, Edgar Allan Poe is another enigmatic source of inspiration for me. Other English authors I appreciate include Thomas Pynchon (though I cannot say I understood his works), Kurt Vonnegut, John Coetzee and Kazuo Ishiguro. My favorite Chinese author is [Wang Xiaobo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Xiaobo), who happened to start his early career as a computer programmer before finally ended up earning a living as a freelance novelist.

Sometimes I find motives in myself to write fictions, not as a career but just for fun. Maybe someday I will!

### Art

I am fond of Vincent van Gogh from a very young age. I like Paul Gauguin, too, but as a layman the best thing I could say is about his exotic concepts.

I also find myself obsessed with Giorgio de Chirico's works and metaphysical art, for no particular reason.

My childhood dream was becoming a painter; but "dream" was all of it. I was said to have painted the Tiananmen blue when I was still a kindergartner, though I can hardly remember if I actually did that. I think I might be qualified enough to be a good graphic designer or an illustrator, in spite of that I'm not an art student; however, as an amateur I am unlikely to risk doing it.

Oh, forgot to mention, I appreciate everything that is transgressive or has some shock value in it. Art can't just be a source of pleasure; it may also be an aggressive gesture.

### Movies

I used to watch a lot of movies. Now I generally avoid them. Watching a bad movie can be a waste of time and even mentally harmful; unlike books, you can't simply skim them even if you've developed good speed reading skills, and you have no option to do other things simultaneously like when listening to music. For the same reason, I no longer watch animes or TV dramas as often as I used to.

I do like good ones of them. There was once a 1960s French science fiction featurette, *[La Jetée](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Jet%C3%A9e)*; it is only 28 minutes in length, monochrome and mostly static, but it's among the best films I've ever seen.

### Music

My favorite music are usually different ones than those I listen to everyday, for my ears need to rest for most of the time before they can perceive good ones.

I nurtured a distaste for most of pop music or club music. Their rhythms might be touching, but very few of them really touches my deeper soul; as a result, they serve as very good BGM for studying and programming, so that I can concentrate on my ongoing tasks rather than the music. I'm not very fond of most art music that appears to be too classical (with the remarkable exception of Beethoven) either, for they often sound too gentle to my ears.

I don't favor any specific genre; basically everything that is labeled as dark wave, neoclassical, gothic or symphonic, I would like to give it a try. If it's Sprechgesang or Neue Deutsche Todeskunst, I often find myself crazy about it. Such musicians I appreciate include [Devil Doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil_Doll_\(Slovenian_band\)) and Lacrimosa. I will try doom metal as well, but those categorized as death, thrash, black or even depressive suicidal often sound too harsh to me. (When I say "too harsh", I mean I would not listen to them all day long, so you know it's really not a kind of disfavor.)

I enjoy music which has some folk spirit in it; among my daily playlist there are Forseti, a peaceful neofolk band (whose name came from the god of justice in Norse mythology); Tenhi from Finland, and Uaral from Chile (sounds of darkness always absorb my soul); as well as heavier metal bands like Falkenbach (a Viking metal group) and Nine Treasures (Chinese-Mongolian folk metal).

A great many Japanese Visual Kei artists also appeal to me, including X JAPAN, Yoshiki, hide, LUNA SEA, MALICE MIZER, the GazettE and MIYAVI. However, this is more like a discography based preference rather than a general interest in the genre. X JAPAN's *Ballad Collection* has the melody that I most want to hear even until the day of my funeral (though I know I won't be able to).

### Idols

Here's the Achilles heel of me—I certainly do not worship anyone religiously, and I am largely against the whole merchandise of pop culture and man-made superstars, for their nature of consumerism and brainwashing. However, I've been a fan (or "wota") of the Japanese idol group AKB48 for a while. It's not just about appealing young girls singing and dancing; it's also about seeing the ones who laughed and cried on the same stage grow up and work hard together, seeing them come and leave, meet and depart; seeing them lead different life goals, pose positively in and out of the limelight. I guess that might be why these girls keep attracting me for so long, but as wise men would say, you don't need a reason to like someone.

For those who might be interested, my kami-oshi is Yukari Sasaki since 2013. My other oshimens include Kyoka Isohara (SKE48) and [Yuria Kizaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuria_Kizaki) for the time being. I also maintain a [Tumblr blog](http://microblog.soimort.org/) for daily translations of Yukari's Google+ posts. Just don't be surprised if I buzz about [Ryoka Oshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryoka_Oshima), [Nana Okada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Okada) or [Nana Owada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nana_Owada)—I'm actually a KSDD, for the most part.

### Food

First of all, cookery is one of my hobbies. And I treat it like a form of experimental art. I cook pasta, omelette, fried rice, chow mein and taco with my own recipes, so they're usually not just Italian, French, Chinese or Mexican; but a brutal mix of them.

IMO, some of the best cuisines in the world—curry rice, chow mein, yakiniku, and spicy tofu hotpot. I also like duck blood and vermicelli soup (which is a traditional delicacy in my hometown), with lots, lots of coriander. I have a mostly Asian appetite, but I'll be glad to try anything else that sounds not so "Asian". Due to lactose intolerance, I avoid dairy products such like milk, cheese and cream as much as possible.

I am reluctant to consume chocolates, cookies, cakes, macarons or any sweet confection that looks too sugary, for health reasons. The only exceptions are lollipops, but I don't eat them as often as I used to.

I used to suffer from seafood allergy when I was younger; now I'm okay with fishes, but still not quite passionate about eating them. I enjoy watching them swim in fish tanks.

I don't eat any species of primates and cetaceans, for obvious reasons. I also refuse to eat domesticated animals which have been trained to work with humans and understand human emotions to some extent, like horses, donkeys and dogs.

### Drinks

I like Espresso, without milk.

I don't have a "good taste" for beers, wines or liquors, as they are all the same alcoholic beverage to me. I used to think there is only flavor of beer in the world, then I visited Belgium and knew that I was wrong. But I like those beers.

### Sports

In general, I enjoy sports, even those I practiced rather badly. However, I don't like to watch professional sports. I get bored quickly, if I'm just watching them but not actually *doing* them.

Sports I most often do are hiking and cycling. Although I'm still kind of aquaphobic, I do like swimming now. I used to practice skateboarding, but not anymore. I'm relatively less passionate about ball games, or any other sports that involved certain forms of scoring. As a pupil grown up and spent most of the youthhood in China, I'm doing surprisingly horrible at ping-pong and badminton, so you would not want to play them with me.

### Travels

I am a solo traveler for most of the time. I have been to America (the United States one), Britain (both England and Scotland), Scandinavia (where I went to college and graduate school) and a few other European countries—all for study or convention related purposes. That is to say, I've never visited a country solely for sightseeing and leisure.

For me, traveling has little to do with how many countries you've visited, how many different places you've stepped in, how many city scenes or landscapes you've seen, or how many photos you've taken. The deep meaning of travel lies upon an inner sense of fulfillment; it's all about experiences: to reach out to an exotic culture, to meet different people, to perceive and to understand, so as to reveal the heterogeneous self.

Some places I most want to visit: (I've got to save money first, of course. I'll just put them down here, and see how far I'll go in my next 20 years)

- Mediterranean Sea, especially the Aegean Islands (a nice place to be, isn't it?)
- Svalbard (because it's so north!)
- Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (though tourism has become more common there)
- Taklamakan (even just once in my life)
- North Korea and DMZ (people say it's like a replica of China of 3 decades ago; however I'd like to see it with my own eyes)
- Mount Kilimanjaro (I've never been to Africa yet; if allow me one place to go, it has to be Kilimanjaro)
- Dallol (it's not like anywhere else on the planet; that's why I want to see it)
- Machu Picchu (seeing photos of it often amazed me too much)

I favor untrodden wilderness much more than civilized tourist attractions, but sometimes I'm also disappointed to see discarded trashes and ruins caused by human activities in those areas. Really. I hope you, a might-be traveler, leave the place you visited as it was, for the sake of newcomers and for the sake of earth.
