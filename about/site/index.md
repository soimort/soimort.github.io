## Browser compatibility

You are now on my site. Congratulations! You are not using a pre-IE9 web browser. This site does NOT support visiting from Internet Explorer 8, or any version older than that.

We don't like Adobe Flash either. It is basically an outdated, vulnerable proprietary web technique which may put your security and privacy at risk. If you are a web developer who still takes Flash seriously, I urge you to consider building your application on [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and other [open standards](http://www.w3.org/standards/).

This site is best viewed in [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/Home), [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) or [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). An up-to-date WebKit-based browser such as [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) would be another reasonable choice. From past statistics of Google Analytics, I learned that about 70% of my visitors are from Chrome (or its derivatives), 12% from Firefox and 12% from Safari. So, if you happen to be among the minority of 6% and having problems browsing this site, please have my condolences.

## Screen Resolution

This site is designed to be viewed in desktop screens at a minimum of 1024×576. The recommended screen resolution is 1280×720 or above (accounted for 95% of visitors).

## User Privacy

I do not track you. And I'm not interested in what you did last summer. However, I've been employing Google Analytics to give myself a better overview of who my major readers are (hopefully you're a Linux user like me, but I'm only 10% confident). It is always good to know who's the target audience when blogging!

For anyone who has a privacy concern, please get a [Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) to prevent your footprints from being sent to Google.
